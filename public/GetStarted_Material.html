        Hello. I do want to speak upon this fact that this is
        utterly and most disrespectable to not understand the beauty
        of the works that I create.
    </p>
    <p>
        First and foremost this has nothing to do with me personally but I
        do want to speak for myself since I cannot accept this kind of
        treatment in any circumstances. Do you really want to face me
        with a mood so bad, that you wouldn't be able to control in any way?
    </p>
    <p>
        Yes I do browse memes, but that does not mean that I'm an Otaku,
        Yes I do watch animes and insta-lock Genji, but that does not mean I'm
        a weaboo.
    </p>
    <p>
        Well, to be really fucking honest, I'm just writing up shit to fill up
        this motherfucking block... and I know I just started swearing
        but I'm really pissed off about the size of the container, so it makes
        me write on and on, but still it doesn't get complete filled.
        Do you think I could fill this up?
    </p>
    <p>
        I am currently listening to the NeiR;Automata right now, and to be
        honest it is really good, and I am considering downloading it
        one night, so that I can listen to it when there is no internet, which is not so uncommon,
        and also to listen when I play games? I don't know, people say that you can
        be pretty good at games if you listen to songs when you play games?
        Like pro gamers do that, like the people from South Korea. Hell they even make
        aimbots and shit for the sake of winning this digital shit piece of games, which
        doesn't really mean that much me personally.
